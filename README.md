## Explanation of Project
    ### Process
        My process when making this assignment was making sure I got the basic format/layout down first and then add in and tweak the details more in the end. Through this process I was able to make sure I finished the most important parts which gave me a more clear view of how to add the details. I made sure to commit after big changes, and add comments to help myself find where specific tags are and to explain them
    ### Challenges
        The biggest challenge I faced while working on this project was getting the layout down. On my dashboard page the placement of all objects varied greatly depending on screen size which resulted in me struggling with figuring out the right use of rows and columns. By looking through Bootstrap documentation and getting advice from my professor I gained a better understanding of how to use the column and grid system within Bootstrap. Another challenge I faced was figuring out how to format content using d-flex. Due to padding and other issues, the content would sometimes not work properly with the flexbox; I overcame this by troubleshooting and working with my professor to figure out different methods using divs and the like to help structure the content. 
    ### What I Learned
        I gained a better understanding of how to use the Bootstrap Framework, as well as how to use other libraries/frameworks in my designs. Through practice with layout in Bootstrap I became better at structuring my designs with Bootstrap, but also with other tools like flexbox and grid. I learnt how to customize Bootstrap through CSS to make the framework my own, and gained a better understanding of the inspect tool through looking for specific Bootstrap classes.
